The `Data` folder contains the following items:
- PIT homeless counts from 2007-2022, state and Continuum of Care (CoC) levels
- PIT counts of beds available in homeless housing resources from 2007-2022, state and CoC levels
- PIT counts of homeless veterans from 2011-2022
- Funding from 2020-2021, state and CoC levels

The `Cleaned Data` folder contains cleaned excel files of the items in data. Some states/territories (like American Samoa) did not collect any data over the years, even though it was included in the PIT files. The cleaned files remove these types of one-off data points.
